# ExtReact REST Example

This application shows you how to use [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and ExtReact's [Grid](http://docs.sencha.com/extreact/6.5.0/modern/Ext.grid.Grid.html) component to build a multi-faceted search interface. Here we use ExtReact's Ext.data.Store with a REST proxy and implement server-side sorting, filtering, and paging using 
node.js and SQLLite.
