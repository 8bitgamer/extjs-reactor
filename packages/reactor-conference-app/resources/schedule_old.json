We’ll also show you how we’ve made GXT more performant across all devices by replacing the programmatic styling and sizing with fully responsive CSS.

        "description": "When looking at large scale and data heavy enterprise applications, we often notice a lack of user experience (UX) design. People today are spoiled with user friendly and modern applications to aid them in their daily tasks for everything from shopping to social networking to ordering a cab; however, they don’t get the same user friendly experience in their work applications. An important challenge for enterprise application developers is that users now expect the same excellent user experience in their work applications as they have in their personal ones. The enterprise market has long been behind the consumer market, but the gap is closing. Ext JS is a superb framework for developing data heavy applications, and it provides a large set of user friendly and customizable components to manage and visualize enterprise data. Furthermore, Ext JS provides the tools you need to build custom and reusable components that will take your applications to the next level. In this session, we will look at how we at Orango have used Ext JS together with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to develop user friendly and modern applications for all platforms. We will also look at real-world examples of custom Ext JS components that are built to provide a great user experience, but also with code maintenance and refactoring in mind. After this session, you will have the tools and knowledge to spoil your enterprise users with excellent user experience.",

Developers, graphic designers, and usability experts alike can modify a theme because there are no special tools required. Everything is centralized, and you can preview changes in an instant. A theme factory gives you a great degree of flexibility, including runtime theme selection and mix-and-match theming. A straightforward BEM naming convention lets you target specific elements and states with precision, without confusing selectors. Better yet, components now follow a model-view-controller pattern that decouples appearance and behavior from state, which means you can quickly customize a widget to meet business needs in ways that just weren’t possible before. Let us show you why theming with GXT has never been easier — or more powerful!",

        "description": "As web and mobile application software development increases in complexity, the frequency of testing is growing exponentially. In today’s competitive business environment, this trend is leading companies and their development teams to see who can deliver the most high-quality product, faster. To have quality code, all features and functionalities must work for all users regardless of browser, OS, or mobile device. The use of automated tests, continuous integration (CI) and open source tools such as Jenkins, git, Selenium, Appium, and test frameworks, over the use of proprietary tools have become keys to success for delivering quality code, ensuring a pipeline is clean, and to implement true CD. Expert Neil Manvar will offer best practices for leveraging modern technologies to develop, test and deliver maintainable, quality code. You will learn the advantages of testing software early and frequently, best practices to leverage modern technologies for test automation and CI, how to avoid shipping bad code, and how to create maintainable code while keeping it “non-legacy”. You will also learn the how and why of creating a robust developer feedback mechanism for sustained success.",

Or Should You Think Universal App!\r\nHistorically, web developers approached app development from the desktop first, and mobile was a secondary goal. Even concepts like responsive design evolved from the desktop side. Developers began with a desktop app and worked their way down to make a responsive app available for smaller screens. But now with the extraordinary growth of mobile users across the globe, that approach is being reversed. Developers are building mobile first, and then making progressive enhancements so the app is available on desktop. Should you be taking either a mobile or desktop first approach, or thinking about Universal Apps to deliver the right user experiences. This approach maximizes the shareability of code across these experiences. In this presentation, we’ll explore case studies that show the benefits of each approach.",

It is one of the most pervasive and accessible languages to date. However, there is a dark side to JavaScript. Developers don't always understand JavaScript/HTML/CSS, so they frequently end up solving problems by coding away in JavaScript when they could, and potentially should, be solved elsewhere. As an unfortunate side effect to this issue, unfamiliarity with the language causes developers to write a lot of code which can have mistakes and be difficult to read and understand. Even more unfortunate is that this problem is cyclical; lots of code begets more code that could have been solved elsewhere and so forth. This talk is not about never writing JavaScript. It is about writing JavaScript when you actually need to and in a minimal fashion. This talk focuses on JavaScript in the browser.",

        "description": "The Futures API helps target Ext JS components and elements directly and allows for easily writing tests, which wait for application elements to reach certain states. It eliminates the need for writing multiple lines of code to test a feature. With Sencha Test 2.0, the Futures API is evolving to support multi-page architectures such as single-sign-on scenarios and others, which require a test to span multiple sites or page loads. Integration with WebDriver in Sencha Test 2.0 adds new features as well as extends some old features to support this new architecture. Come walk through the changes, learn how to deal with typical multi-page test cases, as well as dive into the details of our integration with WebDriver.",

We will share the resulting Open Source Maven plugin with the Sencha community. Sencha Cmd is a powerful build tool for Ext JS applications. Our solution combines the best of both worlds: we use Sencha Cmd for its JavaScript and Sass build expertise; while Maven manages artifacts, dependencies, and integration with other tools like compilers and the Java back-end. The Maven plugin uses the standard Maven workspace layout with a strict separation of source and target as input, and transforms it into the standard Sencha workspace layout. Dependencies and all other configuration that are usually in package.json / app.json are specified in the standard Maven configuration file (pom.xml). Maven takes care of version (ranges), releases, and deployment. Two new Maven module types correspond to Sencha packages and apps. Applications can be built for development as well as for production. Application artifacts are Java JARs with static web resources that can be used directly in Java Web Apps without unpacking. In this session, we'll show you how CoreMedia's Maven plugin offers the deepest integration of Sencha Cmd into your Maven build process available today and takes modular Ext JS development to the next level.",

But still, ask yourself, did you ever run into problems, because your staging system was not an exact clone of production or your continuous integration server runs an old version of Sencha Cmd. Basically, have you ever heard the phrase: \"Everything works fine on my machine?\" Docker is here to rescue you. Running your toolchain, Ext JS application, back-end server, and even your database - all in a standardized container format that can be transported and reused, throughout your process.

Some of us even have to deal with legacy data structures that simply cannot be changed. Luckily Ext JS has a pretty impressive data package that helps us with this task. We simply need to learn how to master it. And this is where this session begins. To connect real model data to a view model, mess around with it, validate it, and then save it back to the server is crucial for any modern application. I will help you understand how some of the key features of the Sencha Ext JS classes work together to handle many of the real world challenges. We will take a closer look at the classes and configs that help us consume and handle the more advanced data structures. I will explain how they are connected and how you can tweak them to your needs. The focus will be on view models, data models, data sessions, proxies, stores, and associations, and how they all come together in a real world application.",

Using Sencha Ext JS 5 as our framework has significantly reduced our development time and application performance is optimal. We will also discuss the challenges we encountered. We'll show you how we used the Ext JS Border Panel, Accordion, Tab panel, Grid and Panel UI components to display the COSMOS data structure in a very comprehensive manner. We also use the ESRI JavaScript API for the mapping component. One of the challenges we had to overcome was to generate multiple address panels dynamically. Creating 500 address panels on the fly would be slow. Our solution was to only create a limited number of address panels in memory and reuse them when necessary. COSMOS (City of Surrey Mapping Online System) is a large scale web mapping application that contains over 300 layers of information on Land Development, Utilities, Parks, Transportation, Crime and Land Use, as well as 15 tools ranging from simple identify, print, and export capabilities to complex property reports and search functionality. COSMOS is used extensively by City of Surrey staff and external users, totalling over 20,000 unique visits per month. It is also provided to two neighbouring municipalities via a SaaS model that can be leveraged in the future for expansion to other municipalities.",

        "description": "Development teams across all industries are realizing that they must be able to deliver quality code frequently in order to keep up with competition, meet user expectations, and to provide an ever-improving experience. Automated testing is critical to ensure that shipping code is quality code. Often testing is not leveraged early and often enough in the pipeline. This results in time being wasted, debugging failures, as well as reverting and rolling back. Because developers are not given feedback regarding their code changes until it is in the repository/pipeline and test automation run against it, it’s difficult to isolate the issue to particular developer commits. The solution to is to test in isolation, giving developers a feedback mechanism that notifies them if their code change is ready for review and merge. Developers need to address any test failures before their code can be put in the main branch and shipped. Other acceptance criteria can be enforced as part of this mechanism. The result is a commonly accepted standard of quality that must be maintained, as well as a set of criteria that must be satisfied before code makes it to the next step in the pipeline. Expert Neil Manvar will be present how testing in isolation can improve quality, increase developer velocity, and allow for organizations to more comfortably embrace and leverage Continuous Delivery. This session will also include a demo of testing in isolation using open source technologies such as Jenkins, Docker, GitHub, and Selenium. You’ll learn the advantages of shifting testing left, the importance of early developer of feedback, and how to best leverage automated testing in a Continuous Deployment pipeline.",
